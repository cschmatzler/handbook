# Vision

**Our vision is to make building at scale easy and delightful for everyone.**

We believe that building software should be a joyful experience, not a painful one. Our goal is to empower developers to focus on what matters most: creating great products. As projects scale, building software often becomes complex and challenging, as many small-scale assumptions and tools no longer apply. Traditionally, organizations have addressed this by absorbing the cost of building and maintaining custom tools and infrastructure, or learning complex tools. However, **we believe that building software at scale should be accessible to everyone**, not just those who can afford it.

While our initial focus has been on Apple platforms, we believe the principles and tools we are developing can be applied to other ecosystems. We aspire to make building at scale delightful for everyone, regardless of the platform they are targeting.

## What makes us different

At the core of our company and software is a commitment to [openness](/engineering/open-source.html). We believe **the best ideas can come from anywhere**, and to harness this potential, we foster an environment where everyone can contribute. We embrace openness with curiosity and confidence, not fear.

Curiosity also drives our innovation. We are passionate about finding new ways to create value, focusing on making things better, faster, and more enjoyable rather than just balancing costs. **We love innovation and strive to continuously improve.** By sharing our innovations, we empower others to build their own businesses and tools. We welcome competition, believing that the best ideas stem from superior execution, which thrives in an inspiring environment â€“ the very environment we endeavor to create.

Moreover, we are strong proponents of [standards](/engineering/standards). We aim to develop solutions that endure over time and give our users the freedom to move their data as they choose. We do not seek to lock anyone into using our platform; instead, we want them to stay because of the exceptional experience they have with Tuist.

Lastly, we meet developers where they are by integrating with their existing toolchains and ecosystems, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution. We collaborate with existing ecosystems and open-source projects to enhance their tools and prepare for future scalability.
