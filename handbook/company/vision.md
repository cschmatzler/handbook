# Vision
Apple's developer tools, [while convenient](https://docs.tuist.io/guide/introduction/cost-of-convenience.html) at a small scale, can be a significant challenge at scale despite enabling more developers to build apps for Apple platforms. Traditionally, organizations tackled these challenges by leveraging community tools or building their own, and by creating teams, usually known as infrastructure, productivity, or platform teams, to maintain them. However, this approach is costly and time-consuming.

**Tuist aims to be the productivity copilot for every organization that builds apps for Apple platforms, ensuring that product teams are productive and capable of building the best apps possible.**

We achieve this by providing an integrated ecosystem of tools and technologies that align and integrate with Apple's ecosystem, meeting developers where they are. 

> [!NOTE] YOUR PLATFORM TEAM
> Think of Tuist as your platform team or the co-pilot to your platform team.

We tackle organizations' challenges without limits, ensuring our solutions seamlessly integrate into a cohesive and user-friendly Tuist ecosystem. Starting with simplifying Xcode project complexities through project generation, we laid a foundation — a language to describe projects — that we'll leverage to offer streamlined, low-configuration workflows.
