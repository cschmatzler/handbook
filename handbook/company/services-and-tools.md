# Services and tools

This document contains all the third-party services and tools that the company uses to operate, and the reasons why we use them.

## Security

### Vanta

We use [Vanta](https://vanta.com) to automate our security compliance. Vanta helps us with SOC 2 compliance, and it provides us with a dashboard that shows the status of our security controls. We chose Vanta because it's a modern and automated solution that helps us save time and resources.

### CanIPhish
We use [CanIPhish](https://caniphish.com/) to provide security trainings to employees. We use them because they offer a reasonable and open pricing model.
