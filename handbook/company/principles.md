# Principles

The heart of Tuist lies in its community and shared ethos. Below, you'll find the core principles that define Tuist's essence and guide our collective journey. These principles serve as our compass, helping us navigate decisions and fostering a unified approach to our work. By embracing these shared values, we ensure that our actions and choices consistently align with Tuist's vision and mission.

## Optimize for happiness

We believe happiness is fundamental to user engagement and satisfaction. In every development decision, we ask: *"Does this spark joy for our users?"*

This principle guides us to seek new perspectives, gather emotional feedback, eliminate complexity, and imagine innovative solutions. While challenging, this approach leads to products users truly love.

Inspired by user-centric philosophies like [Apple](https://apple.com)'s and [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine)', we strive to infuse happiness into all aspects of our work. In an increasingly complex world, we use happiness as a key metric for decision-making and feature evaluation.

By prioritizing joy in our designs, we create experiences that resonate deeply with users, setting our products apart in the marketplace.
