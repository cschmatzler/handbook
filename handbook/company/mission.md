# Mission

**It is Tuist's mission to enable everyone to build better Apple apps faster**

Everyone can build better Apple apps faster with the right:

- Tools
- Data
- Integrations
- Resources

> [!NOTE] WHY ISN'T APPLE DOING THIS?
> Apple has traditionally focus on supporting the "getting started" phase of app development. As apps grow in complexity, developers face challenges that Apple's tools do not address. Tuist is here to fill that gap.

## Tools

Apple's developer tools, [while convenient](https://docs.tuist.io/guide/introduction/cost-of-convenience.html) at a small scale, can be a significant challenge at scale despite enabling more developers to build apps for Apple platforms. Traditionally, organizations tackled these challenges by leveraging community tools or building their own, and by creating teams, usually known as [infrastructure, productivity, or platform teams](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/platform-teams/), to maintain them. However, this approach is costly and time-consuming.

We believe app development doesn't need to be costly if the right tools are available. Unlike other ecosystems, Apple's is dominated by their own tools (e.g., Xcode). Therefore, **we design our tools to align with and integrate into Apple's ecosystem, rather than moving developers away from it.** That makes our tools future-proof and ensures that developers can leverage the latest Apple technologies without waiting for third-party tools to catch up.

Our tools come with sensible, overridable defaults, drawn from our extensive experience working closely with organizations. This ensures that simple tasks are extremely easy, while more complex ones are entirely possible. Developers and organizations shouldn't have to struggle with connecting various disparate tools and data schemas to create workflows. Instead, they receive a set of workflows and tools that are not only easy to navigate but also seamlessly integrated into a cohesive ecosystem.

## Data

Apple's tooling outputs raw information about projects, builds, and developer interactions. However, this data is so unrefined that extracting meaningful insights is challenging. Teams often struggle to answer basic yet critical questions such as:

- What is the average build time of a target?
- Which test has been the most flaky in the past week?
- What is the bottleneck slowing down compilation times?
- Which output artifact has room for optimization?

We believe that **having answers to these questions early on allows teams to steer projects in the right direction, fostering a thriving and productive development environment**. Teams should be proactive about addressing these areas, rather than reacting once issues negatively impact the team.

Tuist plays a crucial role in collecting, processing, and presenting data in a meaningful way for developers and organizations. **We believe data should be actionable, not just informative.** Our goal is to provide insights that help developers and organizations make informed decisions about their projects.

## Integrations

Although teams spend much of their time within Apple's tools, they are part of larger organizations and ecosystems that include complementary tools, such as communication platforms like [Slack](https://slack.com/), version control systems like [GitHub](https://github.com), and telemetry tools like [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/). In other ecosystems, such as web development, tools seamlessly integrate with these platforms, providing developers and leadership with insights to make informed decisions. However, the Apple ecosystem is often siloed within Xcode (e.g., [Xcode Cloud](https://developer.apple.com/xcode-cloud/)), which we believe is a missed opportunity.

**Tuist aims to make it extremely easy to integrate projects and tools with other services.** Integration should be as simple as taking a few steps through a web interface. Any member of the organization should be able to interface with Tuist using only a web browser. We strive to meet every member of an organization where they are, without requiring them to install Apple's tools and translating the information into their preferred language (e.g., business).

## Resources

Many resources provided by Apple or available in the community focus on first-time experiences with technologies, often lacking the depth needed to address the challenges developers face as they scale their projects. Tuist is uniquely positioned to learn about these challenges and provide organizations with the best resources to overcome them. Every interaction with a developer is an opportunity to learn and enhance our resources, which can take various forms:

- Best practices and guidelines in our documentation
- Newsletters and blog posts sharing insights
- Open source tools and libraries that solve common problems

Our goal is to make Tuist the go-to reference for building apps at scale, providing the easiest and most effective path forward.
