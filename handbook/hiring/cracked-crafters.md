# Cracked Crafters

At Tuist, we strive to hire people that are insanely good at what they do.
We call them cracked crafters (inspired by PostHog's [cracked engineers](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/hiring-and-managing-cracked-engineers)).
A cracked crafter is someone who:

- **🙋‍♀️ Take extreme ownership of ideas:** We want people who are not afraid to take ownership of their ideas and drive them to completion. They don't wait for others to convince them to do something. They are proactive and take the initiative to make things happen.
- **😄 Are optimistic:** Cracked crafters are optimistic and stay positive at all times. They are not intimidated by change or new ideas. They adopt a 'yes and' mentality that helps new ideas get off the ground.
- **🤩 Have contagious excitement and energy:** They make people feel excited and energized. Every conversation with a cracked crafter should generate enthusiasm. Cracked crafters build people and their ideas up, and are generally perceived as very helpful.
- **😎 Are authentic:** Cracked crafters behave in a completely authentic way. They don’t play politics – their work does the talking. For example, if you do marketing, talk like an actual human being.
- **👷‍♂️ Apply themselves to the craft:** Joy comes from the craft itself, not creating shareholder value. Cracked crafters apply themselves to the craft of building products with a quasi-religious fervor, and love what they do.
- **🧐 Feel comfortable with uncertainty:** Cracked crafters are comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity. They are not afraid to take risks and are willing to fail. They are not afraid to ask questions and are always looking for ways to improve.

When assessing candidates, we don't look at the companies they worked at, the years of experience, or their popular side projects. We look for the traits above. We believe that if we hire people with these traits, they will be able to learn anything and adapt to any situation.
